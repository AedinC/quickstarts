  prerequisites:
    - You are an Organization Administrator or have **User Access administrator** permissions
    - Users whom you want to limit permissions to read-only for a service or group of services

    Restricting access to services for specific users 
  introduction: |-
    This quick start shows you how to assign read-only permissions to a group in the Hybrid Cloud Console (the console). 
    
    You can use this workflow when you don’t want certain teams or members to make changes in your environment – for example, if you want your security team to be aware of certain items but they don’t need to edit resources or take action. 
    
    To restrict users to read-only permissions on console services, you’ll remove **Administrator** and **Editor** roles from the default configuration in **User Access**. You can then configure additional permissions for specific users as desired.
    
    You can also use this example workflow to customize access to services within **User Access** and modify the **Default Access** group. 
  tasks:
    - title: Removing edit roles from the **Default access** group
      description: |-
        Edit the **Default access** group and remove the roles that you don’t want all users to have. (If the **Default access** group was previously modified, then it’s called the **Custom default access** group.)
        
        For this example, remove all roles that allow you to edit resources from the **Default access** group to remove this access from all users in your organization.
        
        1. Click **User Access** > **Groups**.
        
        2. Click the **Default access** (or **Custom default access**) group. 
        
        3. In the **Roles** tab,  find the roles that you want to remove from the group and select their checkboxes – in this case, all roles with **Administrator** or **Editor** in the name.
        [You can quickly find roles by entering a search term in the Filter by name field above the roles list.]{{admonition note}}

        4. Above the **Roles** list, click&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> (more options) > **Remove** to remove these permissions from all users in the **Default access** group.
        
        5. Click **Remove roles**.

        6. If you are modifying the **Default access** group for the first time, select the checkbox in the warning and click **Continue** to confirm.
        
        Users in your organization now no longer have these roles by default. The **Default access** group is now called **Custom default access**, but any user-created group names have not changed.

        [You can undo any changes made to the **Default access** group by clicking **Restore to default** on the **Groups** page.]{{admonition note}}

          - Go to **Groups** > **Custom default access** and confirm that the roles you removed are no longer in the list of roles assigned to all users in your organization.

        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
    - title: Creating a group with edit roles
      description: |-
        Create a new group for the users who need to manage resources in the console and add the roles you removed from the **Default Access** group. Add the team members to this group who need elevated permissions.
        
        1. Click **Groups** > **Create group**.

        2. Enter a group name (for example, *Admins*) and description, and click **Next**.

        3. Select the checkbox at the top of the list to add all roles to this group, and click **Next**.
        [If you only want to add certain roles, you can quickly find a role in the Filter by role name field above the roles list.]{{admonition note}}

        4. Add any users to the group who need permissions to edit resources. Select the checkboxes for those users and click **Next**.
            [You can quickly find users by filtering by username, email, or status.]{{admonition note}}
        5. Review the group details and click **Submit** to create the group.
        
        You now have a new group called *Admins* that can view and edit resources in the console.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Log in to the console as a member of the *Admins* group, and confirm you can edit a resource (such as an OpenShift cluster).
          - Log in to the console as a user who is not part of the *Admins* group, and confirm you can view resources in the console, but cannot edit anything.

        failedTaskHelp: Try completing the steps again.

      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header

    - title: (Optional) Creating additional groups
      description: |-
        Create additional groups to fine-tune user access to specific services as needed. Add any team members to this group who need those permissions.
        
        1. Click **Groups** > **Create group**.

        2. Enter a group name and description, and click **Next**.

        3. Add the roles required per service and click **Next**.

        4. Add any users to the group who need those permissions. Select the checkboxes for those users and click **Next**.

        5. Review the group details and click **Submit** to create the group.

      # optional - the task's Check your work module
      review:
        instructions: |-
          - Log in to the console as a member of your new group and confirm the access you configured allows you to view or edit resources for the service as desired.

        failedTaskHelp: Try completing the steps again.
      # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
  
  conclusion: |-
    Congratulations! You’ve now configured read-only permissions for most users in your organization, while allowing edit access for only certain users.
    
    After completing this quick start:
    - Users in the **Custom default access** group can view all resources and services in the console, but cannot make any changes. 
    - Users in the *Admins* group can view and edit resources and services in the console.

    A few tips:
    - User access in the console is additive, meaning that each user has the default access permissions, plus permissions from any other groups they are assigned.
    - You can undo any changes you make to the **Default access** group by clicking **Restore to default** on the **Groups** page.
