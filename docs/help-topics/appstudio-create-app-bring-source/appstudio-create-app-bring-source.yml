    Build and deploy your apps in minutes. Tell us where to find your code, and let App Studio do the rest.

    Here are some possible sources for your code:

    1. **GitHub repository**

       App Studio can build apps written in the following languages: Python, Java, Go, and Node.js.
       To get started, add a URL of your GitHub repo. Then, weâ€™ll fetch your code, build a container image for you, and deploy it.

    1. **Quay container image**

       App Studio can use an existing image you already have stored in the Quay container registry. The advantage of an image is that you can code in any language and use any container image type. App Studio will deploy it for you to the Development environment.

    1. **Sample code**

       Try one of our samples to explore App Studio. Samples are great ways to test out different languages in App Studio.

    Once you add your code and click **Next**, you can review the deployment settings.
