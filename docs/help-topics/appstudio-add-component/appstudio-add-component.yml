    An application is a collection of components. To add a component, tell App Studio where to find your code. Here are some possible sources for your code:

    1. **GitHub repository**

       After you provide a Git repo URL, App Studio scans and analyzes the Git directory to determine how many components to add to your application. The number and type of components are determined by the file type in your Git repo, and also by your Git directory file hierarchy.

       For example, your repo might contain in a [devfile](https://devfile.io/docs/2.0.0/defining-environment-variables) or [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/glossary/#dockerfile) for defining a multicomponent application. Or maybe it contains various code sources for App Studio to use for creating a multicomponent application.

       After App Studio analyzes your repo, it builds container images for your components, stores them on Quay, and deploys components to the App Studio Development environment.

       >**NOTE**: App Studio can build apps that are written in the following language stacks and frameworks: Python, Java, Go, .NET, Node.js, Quarkus, and Spring.

    2. **Quay container image**

       Add a link to a container image with your prebuilt app so that App Studio can deploy it to the Development environments. With an image, you can use any programming language you prefer, but you must store it in the [Quay container registry](https://quay.io/).

    3) **Sample code**

       Use one of our samples to explore App Studio. They're a great way to test out different languages and frameworks in App Studio.
