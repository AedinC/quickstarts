    Add components, configure component settings, view logs, and monitor build status - all from a single view.

    Switch between the **Components** and **Environment** views to explore different options.

    **The Components view**

    - Click the **Components** card to review the components and their details.

    - Review your application components build statuses, build logs and history.

    - Change the component settings or delete the component in the **Actions** menu.

    - Add new components to your application. New components are automatically deployed to the Development environment.

    >**NOTE**: We rebuild components when you change the source code in Git repos to keep things in sync.


    **The Environment view**

    - Click the **Development** environment card to review deployed components, their deployment statuses and history.

    - Change the component settings in the **Actions** menu.

    - Review the deployment strategy used for the selected environment. Click **Settings** in the main menu on the left to choose a deployment strategy.

      - The **automatic** deployment strategy means all component updates are automatically deployed to the environment.
      - The **manual** deployment strategy means that you need to manually redeploy a component every time you make some changes to it.
