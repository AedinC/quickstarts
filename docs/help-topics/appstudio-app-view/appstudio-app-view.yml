    Add components, configure component settings, view logs, and monitor build status - all from a single view.

    Switch between the **Components** and **Environment** views to explore different options.

    **The Components view**

    Click the **Components** card to access the following options:

    1. Review the list of components within your application including their build statuses and history.

    2. Check the build logs by clicking **View log**.

    3. Click the **Actions** menu across a component to tweak its settings or delete the component.

    4. Click **Add component** to add a new component from GitHub, Quay or our samples.

    >**NOTE**: We keep an eye on components built from your GitHub code and rebuild them whenever you change the source code.


    **The Environment view**

    Click the **Development** environment card to access the following options:

    1. Review the list of deployed components including their deployment statuses and history.

    2. Click the **Actions** menu across a component to tweak its settings.

    3. Review the deployment strategy used for the selected environment. Click **Settings** in the main menu on the left to choose a deployment strategy.

      - The **automatic** deployment strategy means all component updates are automatically deployed to the environment.
      - The **manual** deployment strategy means that you need to manually redeploy a component every time you make some changes to it.
