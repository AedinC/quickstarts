    Build and deploy your apps in minutes. Tell us where to find your code, and let App Studio do the rest.

    Here are some possible sources for your code:

    1. **GitHub repository**

       Provide a URL of your GitHub repo. Then, we’ll fetch your code, build a container image with your app, and deploy it to the Development environment.

       >**NOTE**: Currently, App Studio can build apps written in the following languages: Python, Java, Go, and .NET languages.

    2. **Quay container image**

       Give us a link to an existing container image stored in the [Quay container registry](https://quay.io/).

       >**TIP**: An image can contain your pre-built app written in any existing programming language, we’ll deploy whatever you have.

    3. **Sample code**

       Try one of our samples to explore App Studio. Samples are great ways to test out different languages in App Studio.

    When you add your code and click **Next**, you will be able to edit the deployment settings.

    **Configure your application**

    We've suggested some default setting values and a runtime environment based on your code. You can always change the settings later, after your component is deployed.

    1. Review the default values. The number of **CPUs**, **Memory** and **Replicas** you can request depends on the amount of resources available to you.

    2. You can set any number of **Environment variables** that we will use during deployment. To add some sensitive data like passwords, click the **Add from ConfigMap or Secret** option.

    3. When everything looks good, click **Create**. Your app will automatically be deployed to the Development environment that is included with this Service Preview.

    As you build and scale your app, this view shows everything you need to know about your app and components in one place.

    **Components**

    You’ll discover a list of your components, their build statuses, and logs in a single view. We keep an eye on components built from your GitHub code and rebuild them whenever you change the source code.

    From the **Actions menu**, you can tweak the settings, such as port value, at any time for each component.

    - Changing global settings of any component overrides global settings across all the environments.

    - Changing build settings only affects one component.

    **Environments**

    Your source code is automatically built and deployed to the Development environment that comes with your Service Preview. You can change the deployment settings for each component as you scale your app across environments from the **Actions menu**.
