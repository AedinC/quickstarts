    Build and deploy your apps in minutes. Tell us where to find your code, and let App Studio do the rest.

    Here are some possible sources for your code:

    1. **GitHub repository**

       Provide a URL of your GitHub repo. Then, we’ll fetch your code, build a container image with your app, and deploy it to the Development environment.

       >**NOTE**: Currently, App Studio can build apps written in the following languages: Python, Java, Go, and .NET languages.

    2. **Quay container image**

       Give us a link to an existing container image stored in the [Quay container registry](https://quay.io/).

       >**TIP**: An image can contain your pre-built app written in any existing programming language, we’ll deploy whatever you have.

    3. **Sample code**

       Try one of our samples to explore App Studio. Samples are great ways to test out different languages in App Studio.

    When you add your code and click **Next**, you will be able to edit the deployment settings.

    **Configure your application**

    We've suggested some default setting values and a runtime environment based on your code. You can always change the settings later, after your component is deployed.

    1. Review the default values. The number of **CPUs**, **Memory** and **Replicas** you can request depends on the amount of resources available to you.

    2. You can set any number of **Environment variables** that we will use during deployment. To add some sensitive data like passwords, click the **Add from ConfigMap or Secret** option.

    3. When everything looks good, click **Create**. Your app will automatically be deployed to the Development environment that is included with this Service Preview.

    Add components, configure component settings, view logs, and monitor build status - all from a single view.

    Switch between the **Components** and **Environment** views to explore different options.

    **The Components view**

    Click the **Components** card to access the following options:

    1. Review the list of components within your application including their build statuses and history.

    2. Check the build logs by clicking **View log**.

    3. Click the **Actions** menu across a component to tweak its settings or delete the component.

    4. Click **Add component** to add a new component from GitHub, Quay or our samples.

    >**NOTE**: We keep an eye on components built from your GitHub code and rebuild them whenever you change the source code.


    **The Environment view**

    Click the **Development** environment card to access the following options:

    1. Review the list of deployed components including their deployment statuses and history.

    2. Click the **Actions** menu across a component to tweak its settings.

    3. Review the deployment strategy used for the selected environment. Click **Settings** in the main menu on the left to choose a deployment strategy.

      - The **automatic** deployment strategy means all component updates are automatically deployed to the environment.
      - The **manual** deployment strategy means that you need to manually redeploy a component every time you make some changes to it.
