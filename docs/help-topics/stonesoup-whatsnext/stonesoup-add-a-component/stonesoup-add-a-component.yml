# Name is an internal name. Title shows up in the UI as a side panel title.
# Tags to be kept empty for now. Tags will specify where in the app descriptions will be available.

  To extend your application, add source code to your repository. Stonesoup then builds a component or image from this source code. 

  1. From the application dropdown, select **Add component**.
  2. When you add a component, the UI automatically starts a pipeline build. 
  3. To verify that the resulting pipeline builds successfully, open the **Activity > Pipeline runs** tab.
