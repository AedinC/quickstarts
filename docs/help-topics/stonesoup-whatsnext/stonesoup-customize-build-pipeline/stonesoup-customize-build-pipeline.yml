  title: Customize build pipeline 
  content: |-
  By customizing your build pipeline, you can change the included tasks, control when those tasks update to newer versions, and then ensure the changes to the pipeline are made only when you’re ready to accept the changes.
  These customizations also configure your repository to automatically build for each commit to this repository for both making and merging pull requests (PR).  
  For each component, you receive a PR that contains the default build pipeline definition. You can customize this build pipeline definition before or after you merge the PR.
  You cannot return to this default pipeline after you make customizations, but you can look at previous pipeline versions in Git. 

  Prerequisites 
  1. Install the GitHub application. 
  2. Authorize the GitHub application for this component’s repository. 

Procedure 
1. From the application dropdown, select **Customize build pipeline**.
* If you already own this build pipeline, you select **Edit build pipeline**.
2. To customize the default build pipeline definition, go to the pull request sent to you and open the component’s source in GitHub. 
3. Make your customizations. 
4. Commit your changes, and as a result, a pipeline builds. 
5. To verify that the resulting pipeline builds successfully, open the **Activity > Pipeline runs** tab.
6. Open the **Overview** tab and merge your pull request.
